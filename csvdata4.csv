python,interpreted,processed at runtime by the interpreter.no need to compile your program before executing it,1
python,interactive,interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs,2
python,cgi,common gateway interface is a set of standards that define how information is exchanged between the web server and a custom script.,3
python,pythonpath,it has a role similar to path. this variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code.,4
python,pythonstartup,it contains the path of an initialization file containing python source code. it is executed every time you start the interpreter. ,5
python,pythoncaseok,it is used in windows to instruct python to find the first case insensitive match in an import statement.,6
python,pythonhome,it is an alternative module search path. it is usually embedded in the pythonstartup or pythonpath directories to make switching module libraries easy.,7
python,data types,numbers string list tuple dictionary,8
python,tuple,sequence data type that is similar to the list,9
python,mysqldb,interface for connecting to a my sql database server from python,10
python,shallow copy,it used when a new instance type gets created and it keeps the values that are copied in the new instance,11
python,ternary operator,it used to show the conditional statements. this consists of the true or false values with a statement that has to be evaluated for it.,12
python,single inheritance,where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.,13
python,hierarchical inheritance,from one base class can inherit any number of child classes,14
python,multiple inheritance,a derived class is inherited from more than one base class,15
python,monkey patching,dynamic modifications of a class or module at run time,16
python,pickling,accepts any python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function ,17
python,unpickling,process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation,18
python,map function,executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as the second argument.,19
python,decorators,decorators in python are used to modify or inject code in functions or classes,20
java,object,objects have states and behaviors.an object is an instance of a class.,1
java,encapsulation,mechanism of wrapping the data and code acting on the data together as a single unit.,2
java,overriding,having two methods with the same method name and parameters.one of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class. overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided its parent class.,3
java,overloading,two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.,4
java,while loop,repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. it tests the condition before executing the loop body.,5
java,for loop,execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.,6
java,do while loop,"like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.",7
java,input stream,the input stream is used to read data from a source.,8
java,output stream,the output stream is used for writing data to a destination.,9
java,catching exceptions,a method catches an exception using a combination of the try and catch keywords.,10
java,finally block,"the finally block follows a try block or a catch block. a finally block of code always executes, irrespective of occurrence of an exception.",11
java,java virtual machine exceptions,these are exceptions that are exclusively or logically thrown by the jvm.,12
java,programmatic exceptions,these exceptions are thrown explicitly by the application or the api programmers.,13
java,non static nested classes,these are the non static members of a class.,14
java,static nested classes,these are the static members of a class.,15
java,inheritance,the process where one class acquires the properties of another. with the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.,16
angularjs,definition,an open source java script framework designed for creating dynamic single web page applications with fewer lines of code,1
angularjs,key features,scope controller model view services data binding directives filters testable,2
angularjs,scope,special java script object that joining the controller with the views ,3
angularjs,data binding,automatic attunement of data between the view and model components,4
angularjs,one way binding,scope variable in the html is set to the first value that its model is assigned to,5
angularjs,directives,markers on a dom element that tell the html compiler to attach a specified behavior to the dom element,6
angularjs,dirty checking,all new scope model values are compared against the previous values,7
angularjs,link function,combines the directives with a scope to produce a live view,8
angularjs,end to end testing,testing an application from start to finish to determine whether all the components are working properly,9
angularjs,dependency injection,dependent objects are injected rather than being created by the consumer,10
angularjs,benefits of dependency injection,testing and decoupling,11
angularjs,single page application,pages are loaded from the server by creating a single shell page or master page and loading the web pages into the master page,12
angularjs,controllers,java script functions that are bound to a particular scope,13
angularjs,services,singleton objects which are instantiated only once in app,14
angularjs,filters,used to show filtered items from a list of items based on defined criteria,15
angularjs,templates,rendered view with information from the controller and model,16
angularjs,routing,controller decides which view to render based on the business logic,17
angularjs,deep linking,allows you to encode the state of application in the URL so that it can be bookmarked,18
angularjs,model,lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data,19
angularjs,view,responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user,20
angularjs,controller,software code that controls the interactions between the model and view,21
